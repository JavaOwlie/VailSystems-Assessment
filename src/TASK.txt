The problem we would like you to solve deals with an array of integers.
We want to rotate these integers to a specified number of positions to the left.

If for example you have an array of integers [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] and we would like to rotate 2 positions to the left, the solution expected would be [3,4,5,6,7,1,2].

Note: the solution should be able to handle a position value greater than the number of integers in the array.
If, for example, we would like to rotate [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]   8 positions to left, it would produce the result  [2,3,4,5,6,7,1].


Negative  values  for  the  positions  to  rotate  will  throw  an  error  which the code example should handle gracefully.
